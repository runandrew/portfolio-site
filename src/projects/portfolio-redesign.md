  Complete redesign of my portfolio site. I wanted to experiment and learn new
  technologies during this overhaul. I ended up deciding to use Hugo, a HTML
  template engine, along with Gulp for automation. I also decided not to use a
  CSS framework and built the grid system and responsive features myself.
